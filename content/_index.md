title: You don’t start out strong. You get strong by starting

**You don’t need to be strong to begin, just ready to show up.** Whether you're pursuing powerlifting goals, starting from scratch or rebuilding strength after a break, the process starts the same: one step, one rep, one session at a time. 

At HJ Strength Coaching, we care about progress you can feel, track, and own. This is strength that builds confidence, carries over into life and stays with you, whatever your goals.
