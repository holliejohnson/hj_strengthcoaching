## Online Coaching

**Online Coaching** is for powerlifters who want smart programming, consistent feedback, and real progress without second-guessing their training. Whether you're preparing for your first meet or pushing for a new total, this coaching is tailored to your goals, experience level, and day-to-day life.

You'll get fully customised programming designed to build strength and develop technique, with weekly check-ins to review progress and adjust your plan as needed. Video feedback helps dial in technique, rep by rep, so you're not just lifting more, you're lifting better.

For those competing under British Powerlifting, I also offer in-depth competition planning and strategy. We'll cover attempt selection, timing, rules, and meet-day logistics so you feel confident stepping onto the platform and can focus on performing at your best.

It’s coaching that adapts with you, keeps you accountable, and supports your goals on and off the platform. Remote doesn’t mean distant - I’ll be in your corner every step of the way.
