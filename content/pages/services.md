## Online Coaching
*Coming soon*


**Online Coaching** is for powerlifters who want smart programming, consistent feedback, and real progress—without second-guessing their training. Whether you're preparing for your first meet or pushing for a new total, this coaching is tailored to your goals, experience level, and day-to-day life.

You'll get fully customised programming designed to build strength where it counts, with weekly check-ins to review progress and adjust your plan as needed. Video feedback helps dial in technique, rep by rep—so you're not just lifting more, you're lifting better.

For those competing under British Powerlifting, I also offer in-depth competition planning and strategy. We'll cover attempt selection, timing, rules, and meet-day logistics so you feel confident stepping onto the platform and can focus on performing at your best.

It’s coaching that adapts with you, keeps you accountable, and supports your goals—on and off the platform. Remote doesn’t mean distant—I’ll be in your corner every step of the way.


## Zero to Hero

**Zero to Hero** is built for anyone starting from scratch—no experience, no pressure, just a clear path to getting stronger. Whether you’re eyeing your first barbell, curious about powerlifting, or simply want to feel more confident in your body, this program gives you the tools to build a solid foundation. 

- Personalised training plan
- Weekly check-ins

In Zero to Hero we lay the foundation for long-term strength by focusing on solid technique, smart progression, and building habits that actually stick. You'll learn how to train effectively and safely, so you can walk into the gym with purpose and know exactly what you’re doing.

**No gimmicks. No guesswork.** 

Just real progress, from wherever you’re starting.
