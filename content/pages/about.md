## Ethos

At the heart of my coaching is a belief in clear, honest communication. I value openness, mutual respect, and working in partnership with the people I coach. You’ll always know where you stand, what we’re working on, and why it matters—no overcomplication, no ego.

My background in statistics shapes how I approach training: with curiosity, structure, and a genuine love for problem-solving. I enjoy using data to guide decisions, planning with intention, and leaning into the strategy—especially when it comes to competition prep and game-day coaching.

But numbers only tell part of the story. I coach people, not just performance. I understand that life outside the gym has a big impact on what happens inside it—and that training needs to reflect the whole person, not just the program. I’ve trained through international competitions and long, quiet spells of just doing what I could. Both are valid. Both have value.

I believe in seasons—times for pushing hard, and times for pulling back. Progress isn’t always linear, and that’s okay. I aim to create an environment where you can train consistently, confidently, and with compassion for wherever you’re at.

At the end of the day, I want coaching to feel like support—not pressure. A space where strength is built with intention, flexibility, and trust.
